## Introduction:
This project focuses on the application of data mining techniques and time series analysis to predict streamflow patterns, a critical component in hydrological studies. The goal is to achieve an in-depth understanding of the streamflow dataset and employ predictive models for accurate forecasting.The diversity in model performances highlights the nuanced nature of streamflow prediction. While classification models provide accuracy in categorical outcomes, the ARIMA model contributes by capturing temporal dependencies and trends in the time series data. The coexistence of classification and time series forecasting methods broadens the applicability of our analysis. we applied machine learning models and time series forecasting methods to predict future flow rates. This project aims to extract valuable insights and enhance forecasting accuracy. The methodology encompasses data loading, missing values handling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of various classification models.
