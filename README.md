## Introduction:
The diversity in model performances highlights the nuanced nature of streamflow prediction. While classification models provide accuracy in categorical outcomes, the ARIMA model contributes by capturing temporal dependencies and trends in the time series data. The coexistence of classification and time series forecasting methods broadens the applicability of our analysis. we applied machine learning models and time series forecasting methods to predict future flow rates. This project aims to extract valuable insights and enhance forecasting accuracy. The methodology encompasses data loading, missing values handling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of various classification models. 

## Dataset:

Weâ€™re using the streamflow dataset for this project.
